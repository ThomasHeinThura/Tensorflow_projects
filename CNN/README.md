* These are datasets focused on CNN models. 
*  Fashion mnist, mnist and sign_mnist don't contain readme files because these are easy and basic datasets. 
*  Cifar 100 dataset is a little challenging. My model is overfitting so test it out if you want to and try to search for the best models. 

For beginner, 
* For those who want to do further study, there are many transfer learning models for classification and GAN(stable diffusion ) models. 
*  For those who want to train other datasets or search for projects, there are medical X-ray datasets, food vision datasets, and object vision datasets.
