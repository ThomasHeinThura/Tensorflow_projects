* These are datasets focus on CNN models. 
*  Fashion mnist, mnist and sign_mnist don't contain readme file because these are easy and basic datasets. 
*  Cifar 100 dataset is little challenging. My model is overfit so test out if you want to and try to search for best models. 

For beginner, 
*  For who want to do further study, there are many transfer learning for classification and GAN(stable diffusion ) models. 
*  For who want to train other dataset or test out, there are medical x-rays dataset, food vision dataset, objects vision dtasets.
