# Introduction. 
* These are Tensorflow small projects for practice. These projects-codes are for those who want to test some projects without wanting to tinker and for those who want to compare the result. 
* These projects are tested on an AMD Ryzen3 5425U laptop and Nvidia 3060 GPU running in Arcolinux (linux 6.1) OS and CPU governor - `performance`. So, time results may vary from tested resources(CPU, GPU, OS).
*  There are some projects which need to download datasets from Kaggle or Tensorflow Dataset and import them on your own.
