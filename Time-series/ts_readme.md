* These are datasets focus on Time series models. 
*  Weathers and Energy datasets don't contain readme.
*  For beginner, you need to know how to make windows and horizons. Inputs and outputs shape is (Number x Time x Features). 
*  There is Weather dataset example Jupyter file, which is direct example from tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series#setup)
*  In that example, there are many models and results. 
*  There is weekly US diesel retail prices dataset. Try to get val_MAE under 0.2%(you can get 0.09 under if you try with transfer learning or dense model).

For beginner, 
*  For who want to do further study, there are many transfer learning mdoels (prophets and XGBoost) 
*  For who want to train other dataset or test out, there are human population dataset, grub taxi dataset, US diesel retail prices datasets and bit coin datasets.
