* These are datasets focused on Time series models. 
* Weathers and Energy datasets don't contain readme.
For beginners, you need to know how to make windows and horizons. The inputs and outputs shape is (Number x Time x Features). 
* There is a Weather dataset example Jupyter file, which is a direct example from Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series#setup)
* In that example, there are many models and results. 
* There is a weekly US diesel retail prices dataset. Try to get val_MAE under 0.2%(you can get 0.09 under if you try with transfer learning or dense model).

For beginners, 
*  For those who want to do further study, there are many transfer learning models (prophets and XGBoost) 
*  For those who want to train other datasets or search for projects, there are human population datasets, grub taxi datasets, US diesel retail prices datasets and bitcoin datasets.
